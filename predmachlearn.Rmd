# Practical Machine Learning, Course Project

## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible
to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively 
inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ 
a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to 
improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are 
tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a 
particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In 
this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, 
forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell 
lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is 
available from the website [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har]).

## Data

The training data for this project are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv).

The test data are available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the participants did
the exercise. The `classe` variable in the data set has five factors:

* A = 
* B = 
* C =
* D = 
* E = 

## Required Libraries

The following libraries are required for this project:

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
```

## Getting Data

The training and test data sets were downloaded from the links given above. 
They were saved in the working directory with their default filenames.

A quick overview of both datasets showed that NA values were registered as 
either `"NA"`, `"#DIV/0!"` or `""`. This argument was used in loading both the
datasets into the workspace.
